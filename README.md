## Setup

#### Backend

We are currently using hardhat for our development/testing environment

The easiest way to start developing is using a local hardhat node

###### Running a Local Hardhat Node

To install all dependencies and run a local evm with hardhat, run:

```bash
cd backend
npm i
npx hardhat node
```

> For this to work, you need `PRIVATE_KEY`, and `INFURA_PROJECT_ID` in your `backend/.env` file. Reach out to luis for these values

To connect to this with Metamask, make sure your node is running. Then,

1. Open your metamask browser extension and click the dropdown

2. Scroll down to the bottom and click "Add Network"

3. For "Network Name", enter something like "Hardhat Local". For "New RPC URL", enter "http://127.0.0:8545", for "Chain ID" enter "31337", for "Currency Symbol" enter "MATIC", and click "Save"


###### Deploying to Local Testnet

npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost

###### Minting on Local Testnet

npx hardhat run scripts/mint.js --network localhost

###### Deploying to Testnet

**TODO**

###### Testing
Make sure to write a unit test for every branch of code in the smart contract.

To run tests:

```bash
cd backend
npx hardhat test
```

###### Deploying

**TODO**

#### Frontend

We are using react for the frontend. Install dependencies and run the app with:

```bash
cd frontend
npm i
npm run start
```

###### Deploying

Make sure to ask Luis to add you as an admin in project so you have ability to deploy

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
firebase deploy
```
